### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Amjad Hossain. I Prefer to go by Nayan, a developer based in Bangladesh. Writing software and solving problems is one of my greatest passion! I have written software in many languages, but I'm particularly fond of C#, NodeJS, and C++.

Besides writing software, I have a passion for sharing knowledge and learning new technology. As such, I'm mentoring the C# and SQL tracks on Mentors Without Borders, posting on Stack Overflow, creating demo applications and libraries, and writing blog posts.
